# [Embrace the Wasp Sting: Why Failure Helps Your Team](https://desertedisland.club/agenda/#adriennetacke)

Adrienne Tacke (Senior Developer Advocate @ MongoDB) | @AdrienneTacke

## Abstract

It's every developer's worst fear…breaking the build! Or worse, bringing down prod!

Much like getting that first wasp sting (especially as a new Animal Crossing player), our first instinct when encountering failure is to run away from it and potentially change our behavior to avoid repeating our mistake!

In this talk, however, I'd like to talk about why that failure is important and how, if given the right environment, it can be the most valuable learning opportunity for all people involved!

Specifically, I'll discuss:

How certain things can only be learned after a failure (like the fact that you can make your own medicine with the wasp nest!)
How others can help us when we discover a failure point (much like villagers helping us out with some free medicine!)
How fostering a psychologically safe environment to fail positively impacts a team (much like discovering the "worst" penalty for being stung twice in a row is a swollen eye and a trip back to your home!)
By the end of this talk, I hope that you'll leave with a new outlook on failure and begin embracing the possible learning opportunities that await your team!

## General Notes

- Failure is often our biggest fear (broken builds, breaking production, being the one at fault)
- Why do we fear failure?
	- It's not pleasant (brings shame, embarrassment, etc.)
	- It feels like a blow to our professionalism
	- Can heighten the feeling of imposter syndrome
	- Can be costly on a money level
		- e.g. An unnamed casino that was saving credit card numbers in plaintext and was fined $250,000,000
- Failure is a chance to collaborate
	- Adrienne didn't know your swollen wasp eye in Animal Crossing would heal with time/medicine until one of her villagers informed her
- Talk to people outside your org/silo
	- There's always someone willing to share/help and they might have knowledge or experience that you don't
- You can harness failure/road blocks to motivate you to push through difficult things (e.g. I can't figure out an error code and that motivates me to slog through the docs for a few hours to learn and understand)
- Everyone on a team needs to know that failure is not a bad thing
	- Make this a frequent talking point to drive it home

## Q&A

- How would you suggest embracing failure in an environment that does not encourage this type of philosophy?
	- Try to get some higher-up people on board with the idea
- What important things do you need to do to learn after you fail? Do you think about why it happened, and possibly learn either yourself or teach someone else to avoid the problem in the future? Or log things in a wiki as something that can happen, but not to be discouraged?
	- Document things you found or learned in terms of debugging so future people don't have to struggle to, for example, find where the most useful logs are
	- Have formalized retrospective meetings
	- Foster a culture where everyone tries to learn from everyone else

		- I really like "What surprised you?" as a retro question too
	- @jessemillar
		- I've had great success in using personal postmortem documents when trying to learn from a failure (big or small). I found a simple postmortem template that I liked and spun up a public repo (public inside my company) to host all my docs. At the end of projects/sprints/individual feature development, I write a postmortem and share it out with the team. Sharing helps me be accountable, foster a culture that accepts failure at varying levels, and inspires other people to also self-examine and learn as much as possible from their individual experiences.
