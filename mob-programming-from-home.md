# [Mob Programming From Home: A Case Study in Teaching Cloud Migration From YOUR Island Getaway](https://desertedisland.club/agenda/#torichu)

Tori Chu (Developer Specialist @ Nationwide) | @f00handle

## Abstract

"Mob Programming" is a software development approach that goes beyond pairing to engaging your whole team and solving a problem together. See how this method is being used to teach cloud migration to dev teams that have rarely touched ops before - while migrating real-world enterprise apps in the process. With the sudden pivot to working from home, learn the best practices that were discovered to keep your now-distributed island villagers (coworkers and trainees) up to speed on new technology and concepts, whether WFH or not!

## Speaker Biography

## General Notes

- They're solving onboarding of new developers via virtual mob programming
- Mob programming is when you have a bunch of people working together simultaneously on the same work at one computer with a rotation mechanic to allow multiple people to "drive" and get hands-on experience
- Make sure you switch drivers frequently
	- Set an alarm so you don't get sucked into debugging one problem
- When mod programming remotely, do one hour driver windows
	- In person, 15-20 minutes is suggested

- Do end of session/day/week retrospectives to make sure things are efficient and have value

## Q&A

- Is there a sweet spot in regards to how many people should be involved in mob programming?
	- Small enough that people don't check out between rotations in the "active" roles of driver/navigators (probably 6-9)
- How do you handle the logistics in the remote mob programming call? What happens if everyone starts talking over each other? How do you make sure the quieter person in the room gets a word in?
	- Mute everyone. Have folks raise their hands when they want to talk. Or let everyone talk and have the quieter folks raising their hands trigger a mass mute.
- Are there recommended mechanisms for handling rabbit holes, or for when folks begin diving too deep on things that can derail flow? Additionally, are there opportunities for sidebars for these sorts conversations, or is that antithetical to the mob programming practice?
	- @Minilla#5977
		- "We've had some success by designating a person with the job of watching out for rabbit holes in other meetings, I wonder if that would work for mob programming"
- How do you keep the introverts engaged? So it stays mob and not just 1-2 team members.
	- Use async communication methods so you don't have to pipe up over voice chat
