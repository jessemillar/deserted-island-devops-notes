# [Sticking Together while Staying Apart: Resilience in the time of global pandemic](https://desertedisland.club/agenda/#aaronaldrich)

Aaron Aldrich (Advocate @ LaunchDarkly) | @crayzeigh

## Abstract

Everything is a little bit broken all of the time. Sometimes, like recently, as in right now, the core truths and assumptions about the universe seem to be shifted out from underneath us without warning. And yet, Netflix streams movies, GitHub serves code, we all keep going and working from home and surviving. These systems, both technical and social, are resilient. And through their resilience they are able to handle all those one-in-a-million occurrences that crop up nine-times-in-ten. But what does it mean to be resilient? And further, how can we recognize and grow this resilience to better deal with the systemic surprises we're dealing with right now and in the future? What does a resilient team look like, and how do you foster that?

This talk will answer:

- What is Resilience?
- How can we create resilience in ourselves, teams and systems?
- How do our networks of systems (people, teams, organizations, applications) create resilience for each other?
- What happens when major systems and networks fail?
- How can we discover and foster resilience in our people, teams and systems?

## General Notes

- The slide deck [is available here](https://speaking.crayzeigh.com/KLBLgb/sticking-together-while-staying-apart-resilience-in-the-time-of-global-pandemic)
- "Everything's a little bit broken all the time but it somehow keeps working"
- "Million-to-one chances crop up nine times out of ten"
- You can't really separate humans from complicated systems
	- They called this "socio-technical systems"
- Conway's Law
	- Designed systems represent an organization's communication structure
- Think about a problem with one of your systems
	- How did you find out there was a problem?
	- How surprising was this incident?
- Look at Google's findings for functional teams
- "Resilience is about creating the conditions that maximize everyone's potential"
- "Community Building *is* Resilience Engineering"

## Strong Communities

- Strong communities are:
	- Diverse
		- Lots of knowledge and perspectives
	- High trust and safety
		- You can be yourself
	- They sustain and repair themselves
		- This is why we have codes of conduct to make safe spaces
	- Inter-predictability
		- You learn how people operate inside the community
	- Communities are made of loosely coupled, layered networks/communities
- Look to the current pandemic for examples
	- Grocery stores have specific hours for vulnerable shoppers and no government made stores do that
	- School districts are delivering meals to kids that are at home
	- People are volunteering and sewing face masks

## Common Ground

- "Teams that do well dealing with impact are those that have a strong common ground."
- Common ground means:
	- You have a "basic compact" setting availability of personnel
	- Goal alignment/commitment
	- Inter-predictability
	- Sustain and repair

### Building Common Ground

- Have blameless postmortems
	- Don't find a scapegoat, instead identify learnings
- Chaos engineering
- Game days
- Model vulnerability

## Terminology

- Sharp End
	- Closest to the work, practitioners
	- Constantly building and destroying systems
	- Strong signaling
	- The people improving systems
- Blunt End
	- Removed from the experience; upstream decision makers

## Components of Resiliency

1. Rebound
	- How quickly back to normal after a surprise
	- Work done ahead of time
1. Robustness
	- The ability to withstand and absorb well-modeled disturbances
1. Graceful extensibility
	- The ability to stretch with challenges to operational boundaries
1. Sustained adaptability
	- Recognizing and managing adaptive capabilities over long timescales

## Bones

- Bones are naturally resilient
- Bones are constantly created and destroyed
- Bones are managed subconsciously
- Bones regrow on their own
	- If you set a bone and create good conditions for its regrowth it does much better
- Bones are like strong communities

## Q&A

- How do you feel about the terms "postmortem" vs "retrospective"
	- Doesn't love "postmortem" but recognizes that it's basically the industry standard term
	- Call it a retrospective if you can, but don't unnecessarily fight the norm
