# [Building Virtual Community](https://desertedisland.club/agenda/#miamoore)

Mia Moore (Developer Advocate @ IBM) | @xomiamoore

## Abstract

At its core, Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a game about building a community — literally — on a remote island. Right now, many of us are also experiencing our own version of remote living, though luckily with many of life’s modern conveniences. Without in-person events, meetups, and interactions, it’s crucial to create or maintain digital spaces for developer communities.

This talk will explore converting a face-to-face community to a virtual community, a few tools (like Twitch) you can use, and how to be a good citizen of these communities. You’ll leave with a few examples to hopefully inspire you and an answer to the all-important question — how is community building like Animal Crossing?

## General Notes

- The slide deck [is available here](https://twitter.com/xoMiaMoore/status/1255909285583826944)

- Community proves a means for people connected by common need, geography, or interest
	- Allows members to share knowledge/empathy
- Community building is led by individuals, not brands
	- Trust is crucial to building a strong community and it's easier to trust an individual than a faceless organization
- It's your place as a community manager to make sure members of your community are getting value out
	- How does your community provide value?
	- How can you replicate that value in a digital medium to continue your community during the pandemic?
		- Understand that things will be different, but that doesn't mean things will be worse (often things will be better)
- Choose your community platform and tools consciously
- Avoid forcing people to learn a new tool to use your community
	- Don't give in to the "shiny toy" syndrome
- Try not to move your community between tools multiple times
- You get what you give in a community

## Creating a Community

### Getting Started

1. Find an opportunity for a community
	- Look for a gap where you wish there was a community but you can't find one
1. Partner with 1-2 folk
1. Welcome collaboration
	- Don't just build a community for yourself
1. Request iteration and feedback

### Maintaining the Community

1. Create a code of conduct with
1. Use inclusive, welcoming language on your public-facing text
1. Value the community's input but have some final decision makers
1. Keep an eye out for bad actors and enforce the code of conduct
1. Make sure there are people besides you in the community who can lead/maintain so that in your absence the community thrives.

### Be a Good Citizen

- Follow the rules
- Assume the best in people (default to empathy)
- Show effort
- Celebrate successes
- Give to others freely
	- "All gifts must be given without strings attached"

## Q&A

- How to make virtual communication more human?
	- Try to clarify what you're saying so it can't be misconstrued
	- In text communication, emoji help convey tone
- Tips for building communities in a corporate context?
	- Try to bridge gaps between teams and talk to people outside of your area/school of thought
- "How do you deal with 'social burnout'. I notice that every time I've been a mod/community leader in a digital community, the checking of the community posts felt like a chore really fast, which I rarely have as a 'normal user'. I think it has to do with the expectation to always be 'on' as a community organiser. Do you recognise this? And do you have tips to deal with it?"
	- Have more people that help with moderating
	- You don't need 24/7 moderation
	- There's a chance building a community might not be "for you"
		- Maybe you instead want to be an active community member instead
