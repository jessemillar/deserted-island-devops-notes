# [KEYNOTE: Bridge Construction Kit: DevOps and Security Don't Have to Be Islands](https://desertedisland.club/agenda/#iancoldwater)

Ian Coldwater (Lead Platform Security Engineer @ Heroku) | @IanColdwater

## Abstract

Devops and security have a lot to learn from each other, but there are gaps in communication and understanding between the two. How did these flaws come to be, and how can we work to remediate them? This talk contains ideas, a call to action, and some terrible puns. Let's figure this out together, so we can build bridges between our islands, catch more bugs, and craft things better.

## Speaker Biography

Ian Coldwater is a grown teenage hacker turned Lead Platform Security Engineer at Heroku, who specializes in hacking and hardening Kubernetes, containers and cloud-native infrastructure. In Animal Crossing, Ian runs The Cloud out of their basement data center. In real life, Ian lives in Minneapolis and tweets @IanColdwater.

## General Notes

- "Security isn't a blocker. It's integral."
- We are all on the same team working toward the same goals
	- We can do better, by ourselves *and* with each other
- Sounds like Heroku (at least Ian's team) has a really good developer culture with healthy inter-team communication

## Root Cause Analysis

- DevOps and security teams are often at odds, but they don't have to be
	- "Silos are for grain"
- Security potentially sees devs as "moving fast and breaking things"
- Developers potentially see security teams as something that slow them down
	- Most developers (on all teams) want to do well, they just have a lot going on

### Fixes for Poor Communication

- Approach other teams/people with empathy
- Good communication takes practice
- DevOps is about continuous improvement, focus on continually improving your communication skills
- Create, discuss, and share blameless postmortems
- Make documenting as you go a priority
- Strive to get teams thinking/communicating on the same page
- "Chop trees, carry water" - Kubernetes Community
	- Put in work
	- Do things together, for each other
	- Be humble
- Understand that not everyone thinks like you
	- DevOps people:
		- Understand that not everyone wants to quickly slap together software that works quickly but has super open/insecure defaults
		- Loop security in during development
	- Security people:
		- Keep up with the latest trends/technology so you can understand what's being built
		- Try not to be "the Team of No" (learn to talk to people on their level and have conversations instead of just vetoing things)
- Don't be afraid be vocal or shake things up
	- Breaking down walls doesn't happen silently
