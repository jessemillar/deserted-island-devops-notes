# [You've Got A Friend In Me](https://desertedisland.club/agenda/#katyfarmer2)

## Abstract

Communities and relationships affect how we work, why we work and what we work on, so it's natural to feel unproductive or unmotivated at a time when they are at risk. Lets talk about productivity while working under quarantine, the risks and symptoms of burnout, and how we take care of ourselves in a uniquely difficult time. I'll share some of my own strategies and open up discussion for others to share theirs as well. We're all in this together!

## Speaker Biography

Katy lives in Oakland, CA (but has lived in lots of places from East Coast to West Coast), and loves to experiment with technology. Over the years, she's been an editor, juice bar barista, IT technician, and farm hand, so she's learned to fail and try again in a lot of industries. Ask her about video game development, Russian Literature, Star Wars, or Dragon Age--she'll be your friend right away.

## General Notes

- "I like to draw things and they turn out how they turn out"
	- I really like that mentality; it can super easily apply to a lot of things
- This talk is about acknowledging that we're all stuck inside for the greater good
- Be kind to yourself
	- This pandemic situation is not normal
	- This is not just working remotely
	- Lower productivity is normal
	- A global pandemic qualifies as *traumatic*
- Let yourself have feel-good moments
- You are valuable even when you are not productive
- You are precious and are worth time and care
- "You are being your best self even when it feels like being your best self is not enough. It is!"
- "Remember, if you need a friend, you've got a friend in me"

## Coping Strategies

1. Breathe
	- If one deep breath is all you can do, great, but many breaths will do wonders
	- Don't turn those breaths into a plethora of sighs
1. Phone a friend
	- "Use your cell phone as a phone"
	- Send messages to people
		- Use GIFs
		- Use emoji
		- Write emails to people you wouldn't normally send emails to
	- Use social media but also know when to step away from it
		- "Fill your feeds with positive people"
1. Make checking the news deliberate instead of "wandering into it" (unfollow news accounts on social media)
1. Look for joy
	- Make art
	- Buy art
	- Look at pictures of animals
	- Give yourself permission to do nothing
		- You can't expect yourself to be busy all the time
1. Support your community
	- Support local businesses
	- Give money to closed businesses
	- Give people compliments
