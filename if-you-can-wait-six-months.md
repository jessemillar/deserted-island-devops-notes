# [If You Can Wait 6 Months, You Should](https://desertedisland.club/agenda/#davidsudia)

## Abstract

Or, how the real-time nature of Animal Crossing informs DevOps practices.

The current DevOps ecosystem is moving incredibly fast, and I've found that because of that it often pays toâ€¦slow down. You can start building off that cool new tool now, or wait until there's a one-command CLI to deploy the whole thing for you.

Of course, sometimes you need feature X right now and can't wait, in which case, get going!

I've learned this lesson over and over in the last three years of working in the Cloud Native ecosystem and would like to share my experience of when it's been worth being an early adopter, and when, like planting those non-native fruits instead of immediately selling them for those sweet, sweet bells, it's worth waiting.

## General Notes

- The speaker really likes Animaniacs
- They coordinated their IRL outfit with their in-game one and they were sad the Zoom call wasn't broadcast so people could see
- "If You Can Wait 6 Months, You Should"
	- This phrase is meant to discuss infra and ops concerns, not giving advice to startups
- "Animal Crossing encourages you to wait, take a little more time, and be patient"
- DevOps pushes things out so fast and it's so tempting to jump in and start using things quickly
	- If you can, it's worth it to wait six months before trying a new, emerging technology
- Try to be wary of too much abstraction
	- Abstraction can often introduce/trade complexity in unexpected ways
- They used the craftable robot/mech in Animal Crossing as an example for good things you have to wait/work for instead of getting instant gratification
- Some times there are enough benefits to an emerging technology that it's worth rolling in some of your own fixes while you wait for the community to finish putting together the final implementation of something that hits all your use cases
	- Use your Animal Crossing pole vault to navigate your island in order to increase profits, but also know that bridges are coming
- Always keep your eye on the horizon
	- Re-read docs and announcements for products/technologies every six months for things that you're waiting for since things move fast and the product might unexpectedly do exactly what you need after an surprise release
		- This is doubly useful since sometimes you'll find a new feature/technology that solves a problem you didn't know you had

# Q&A

- "If we all wait six months before adopting the new shiny, who finds and fixes the bugs early adopters would hit?"
	- If you need something right now, maybe it's worth writing some shims to make it work for you now in the MVP state
